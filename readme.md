**This is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion**

Bangalore Startups is an open group for Entrepreneurs and Aspiring Entrepreneurs. 

A community where people brainstorm their idea, seek help to remove road blocks, share articles, sort feedbacks and if possible get early adopters for their startups.

Please treat this discussion group with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.

These are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.

**Improve the Discussion**

Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the discussion or might detract from its usefulness, think over what you want to say and try again later.

The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.

One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Please spend some time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.

**Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree**

You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But, remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:

- Name-calling.
- Ad hominem attacks.
- Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
- Knee-jerk contradiction.
- Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.

**Your Participation Counts**

The conversations we have here set the tone for everyone. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this group an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.

Let’s try to leave our park better than we found it.

**If You See a Problem, Report It**

Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this group. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.

When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just report it.

In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts in any way; the moderators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.

**Always Be Civil**

Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:

- Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
- Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
- Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
- Respect our group. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the group.
- These are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post/comment was featured on the front page of TOI or TechCrunch.

**Keep It Tidy**

Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up.

Job Posts, Co-founder search, Freelance Hire or requirement, Talent available, Interns opportunity, and Connect Requests (lawyers, CAs, companies, etc). Technical Suggestion, Office Space, etc also should be posted in the new group. There are separate thread dedicated for these and also a new sister group.
